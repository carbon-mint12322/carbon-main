# Farmbook scorecard

We use a scorecard to continuously measure the performance of a cropping system. The scorecard contains the following components:

1. Compliance score
1. Regenerative score (Carbon score)
1. Nutrition score
1. Food safety score
1. Yield Estimate(s)
1. Agricultural Capital

The following sections describe how each of these scores is calculated and validated.

## Compliance score

A compliance score indicates how well a system is performing relative to a scheme, such as an organic certification scheme or a climate regenerative scheme, similar to Verra. The score is calculated as a percentage, with 0 as "Failure" to 100 as fully compliant with scheme.

    0 .............................................100
    FAIL                                        FULLY
                                                COMPLIANT

The score calculation takes the following factors into account:

1. Sufficiency of data - is there enough data to calculate the score?
1. Agri Practice events -
1. Measurements/Tests
1. Custody

## Regenerative score

Factors

1. Waste management
1. Inputs - climate fiendly?
1. Inputs - local?
1. Water efficiency
1. Biodiversity
1. Soil foodweb score
1. Seed regeneration practices
1. Land productivity

## Nutrition score

Factors:

1. Vitamin quality/quantity
1. Minerals
1. ??

> One way to visualize the nutrient density of foods is to determine the percentage daily value (%DV) of different nutrients per serving, always in relation to calories. Thus, a 6-ounce serving of plain skimmed-milk yogurt supplied <5% DV of daily calories but >30% DV of calcium, >25% DV of phosphorus, >10% DV of potassium and zinc, and >5% DV of magnesium. Similarly, a fruit-flavored low-fat yogurt provided <10% of dietary energy but >25% DV of calcium, >20% DV of phosphorous, close to 15% DV of protein, and >10% DV of potassium. Given the favorable nutrients-to-calories ratio, a yogurt can be defined as a nutrient-rich food.
