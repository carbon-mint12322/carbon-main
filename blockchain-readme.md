   maps, seed tracing, GAP activities, chemical residue testing,
   certifiation body audit records etc are recorded in immutable
   storage baced by blockchain.

2. Transaction records: Financial transaction records of sale of
   produce are recorded in the blockchain and are packaged with crop
   historical records as QR codes for easy review and inspection.
